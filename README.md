# cerebral

App designed for users to record their thoughts and emotions to assess patterns over time. The app will include journaling components and emotional ratings on various scales so that users can see how their mental state changes over time. Potential for machine learning to be used to assess how certain persistent thought patterns or themes from journals affect emotional ratings. Can be used in cognitive behavioral therapy to reframe negative or self-destructive thoughts or behaviors. Still in development.

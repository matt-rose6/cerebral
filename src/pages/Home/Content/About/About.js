        Cerebral is an app designed to help you keep track of your emotions and
        experiences in an organized and simple way. The app uses a journaling
        component and weekly surveys that measure feelings and behaviors
        associated with depression to try to find relationships between your
        thought patterns and symptoms. The app uses the Beck Depression
        Inventory to help assess these symptoms, and sentiment analysis to
        analyze the contents of your journal entries.
        <br /> <br />
        Cerebral is meant to be a tool to help facilitate understanding between
        you and your therapist, and we are always trying to find ways to improve
        this connection. Feel free to reach out to the creator of this app at
        matt.rose@duke.edu if you have any questions, feedback, or concerns
        about Cerebral.
